##### **Odia Gen AI, Lead Scientist**
> - ###### Focussing on creating Large Language Models for Native Indian Languages.
> - ###### My team and I have released a validated Odia Instruction set of 171K with 10K instructions of domain knowledge for the Orissa state
> - ###### We have also released a Bengali Instruction Set of 252K Large Language Model Tuning
> - ###### Recently I fine tuned LLama2 7B and 13B with Qlora to create 2 versions of Odia LLama2. The models would soon be released for public use
> - ###### Check out our work [here](https://www.odiagenai.org/)
> - ###### Working on couple of Papers :grin: Hope to publish them soon.

##### **DriQ, Research Scientist and Consultant**
> - ###### Creating novel AI system to manage sensor data to monitor humans diaper's state in nursing home.
> - ###### Working in Collaboration with Dr Gregory Dean and his team to deliver potential AI product line up that they can employ at hospitals
> - ###### Some Products include: Deployed XGBoost Model to predict wet and dry state of human along with percentage wetness; LLM powered chatbot hosted on their website for customer interaction; Unirary Tract Infection Predictor


##### **Google Summer of Code Fellow , CERN Switzerland Geant 4 Team, 2022**
> - ###### Worked in a team of 3 where I was mentored by 2 CERN Physicists
> - ###### My work has been published at CERN at the following [link](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/blogs/2022/blog_Geant4_GuneetSingh.html).
> - ###### **Performance Optimization:**
>   - ###### Experimented with various parameters (float precisions, event numbers, angles, and energy ranges) to maximize data handling capabilities of the pipeline on an 8GB CPU setup. 
>   - ###### Successfully restructured Python code into Kubeflow function format for improved efficiency and maintainability. 
> - ###### **Streamlined Workflow:**
>   - ###### Implemented a user-friendly, one-click pipeline solution within Kubeflow, abstracting complex workflow details for ease of use. 
>   - ###### Configured Persistent Memory with EOS in Kubeflow Pipeline, ensuring data integrity and accessibility. 
> - ###### **Scaling and Resource Efficiency:**
>   - ###### Adapted the training loop to efficiently handle large datasets (1 TB) on limited hardware resources (8GB CPU), enhancing scalability and reducing computational costs. 
> - ###### **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
>   - ###### Integrated Katib Hyperparameter tuning seamlessly into the pipeline, optimizing model performance and resource utilization. 
> - ###### **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:**
>   - ###### Produced well-designed, thoroughly documented code that serves as a valuable resource for users seeking to implement Kubeflow methodologies for diverse workflows. 

[//]: # (>   - ###### Created comprehensive documentation to facilitate understanding and adoption of Kubeflow Workflow, contributing to knowledge dissemination within the team.)
[//]: # (> - ###### **Automated Configuration:**)

[//]: # (>   - ###### Developed automated processes to submit and configure the Pipeline setup and Katib YAML directly into the Kubeflow Dashboard, minimizing user involvement and potential errors. )



##### **CORD.AI, Core Founding Member, NLP Community Lead**
> - ###### Cord AI is a research community led by a group of students and early career professionals to promote research and professional participation in AI.
> - ###### Our task is to help young students and working professionals enjoy the flavor of research and work on impactful problems.

##### **Alan Turing Institute + Leeds University + ASDA, Visiting Researcher, 2021**
> - ###### Using econometrics modeling and Tree-Based ML, we derived statistical relations between weather conditions and their effects on ASDA Stores LTD, United Kingdom sales.
> - ###### More than 90 Million Data points worth of Dataset was modelled and experimented on in the project
> - ###### A detailed publication of the project can be found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2022-04/the_alan_turing_institute_data_study_group_final_report_-_asda.pdf)


##### **Save the Children (USA), AI for Social Good [Fight against Online Child Grooming]**
> - ###### Currently leading the technical department of an Online Anti Child Grooming system through which young children can be saved from groomers and predators on platforms like Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Steam, Discord, etc.
> - ###### Working in collaboration with Github, Save the Children Sweden
