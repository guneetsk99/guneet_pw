Hey, How you doing. I am Guneet Singh, an AI Scientist at GreyOrange in the morning and Independent Researcher at night. I completed my undergraduate last year in July 2022 in Computer Engineering from Thapar University, India.
Since 3rd of year of my college I have been collaborating with different Professors on various domains of AI.It wasnt an easy journey because my college didnt had a research culture for undergrad students especially in NLP. I had to work a lot on my own looking for right people
with whom I could work with. This is one the of reason why I got a chance to work in different fields and gain valuable experience about AI as a whole. Formally I have experience with Natural Language Generation, Inference, Multimodal  and Multilingual systems. My direction now is to move towards AI for Social Impact using my knowledge and parallely understand the behaviours and functioning of Large Language Models.
**I am currently looking for PhD opportunities and would be happy to connect.** 

Rest if I am not working I am collecting books, hitting gym, playing badminton or cafe hopping. When I am stressed and mentally exhausted you can find me cooking.
After my retirement I will definitely like to open up my Restro where I experiment with food just like currently I am experimenting with AI. **I am open to suggestions about your favourite dishes**
